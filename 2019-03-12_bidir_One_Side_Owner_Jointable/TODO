TRIED TO DO:
Jointable; saving from all sides without mappedBy and with different bidirectional management

REPORT
Also, if you didn't have mappedBy AND didn't have
cascade then the Parent owns the relationship and if you put NEW children in
the list and then save the Parent it will *throw an exception* because the new
children ID's aren't available to be saved in the join table. 
 ^ exception doesn't test OK. possibly a glitch
 
Regardless of mapping / jointables, you ALWAYS need bidirectional management!
