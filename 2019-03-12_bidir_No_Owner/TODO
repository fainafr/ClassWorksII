Check how jointable works in o2m;
Check cascade saving child / parent;

TRIED TO DO:
Jointable; saving from one side without mappedBy and without cascade;

REPORT
Also, if you didn't have mappedBy AND didn't have
cascade then the Parent owns the relationship and if you put NEW children in
the list and then save the Parent it will *throw an exception* because the new
children ID's aren't available to be saved in the join table.
